# Upgrade Seafile Docker

For maintenance upgrade, like from version 10.0.1 to version 10.0.4, just download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version, then start with docker compose up.

For major version upgrade, like from 10.0 to 11.0, see instructions below.

Please check the **upgrade notes** for any special configuration or changes before/while upgrading.


## Upgrade from 10.0 to 11.0

Download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version. Taking the [community edition](../docker/deploy_seafile_with_docker.md) as an example, you have to modify

```yml
...
service:
    ...
    seafile:
        image: seafileltd/seafile-mc:10.0-latest
        ...
    ...
```

to

```yml
service:
    ...
    seafile:
        image: seafileltd/seafile-mc:11.0-latest
        ...
    ...
```

 It is also recommended that you upgrade **mariadb** and **memcached** to newer versions as in the v11.0 docker-compose.yml file. Specifically, in version 11.0, we use the following versions:

- MariaDB: 10.11
- Memcached: 1.6.18

What's more, you have to migrate configuration for LDAP and OAuth according to <https://manual.seafile.com/upgrade/upgrade_notes_for_11.0.x>

Start with docker compose up.

## Upgrade from 9.0 to 10.0

Just download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version, then start with docker compose up.

If you are using pro edition with ElasticSearch, SAML SSO and storage backend features, follow the upgrading manual on how to update the configuration for these features: <https://manual.seafile.com/upgrade/upgrade_notes_for_10.0.x>

If you want to use the new notification server and rate control (pro edition only), please refer to the upgrading manual: <https://manual.seafile.com/upgrade/upgrade_notes_for_10.0.x>

## Upgrade from 8.0 to 9.0

Just download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version, then start with docker compose up.

### Let's encrypt SSL certificate

Since version 9.0.6, we use Acme V3 (not acme-tiny) to get certificate.

If there is a certificate generated by an old version, you need to back up and move the old certificate directory and the seafile.nginx.conf before starting.

```shell
mv /opt/seafile/shared/ssl /opt/seafile/shared/ssl-bak

mv /opt/seafile/shared/nginx/conf/seafile.nginx.conf /opt/seafile/shared/nginx/conf/seafile.nginx.conf.bak
```

Starting the new container will automatically apply a certificate.

```shell
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Please wait a moment for the certificate to be applied, then you can modify the new seafile.nginx.conf as you want. Execute the following command to make the nginx configuration take effect.

```sh
docker exec seafile nginx -s reload
```

A cron job inside the container will automatically renew the certificate.

## Upgrade from 7.1 to 8.0

Just download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version, then start with docker compose up.

## Upgrade from 7.0 to 7.1

Just download the new image, stop the old docker container, modify the Seafile image version in docker-compose.yml to the new version, then start with docker compose up.


## Upgrade from 11.0 to 12.0 (In progress)

From Seafile Docker 12.0, we recommend that you use `.env` and `seafile-server.yml` files for configuration.

First, backup the original docker-compose.yml file:

```sh
mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.bak
```

Then download [.env](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/env), [seafile-server.yml](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/seafile-server.yml) and [caddy.yml](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/caddy.yml), and modify .env file according to the old configuration in `docker-compose.yml.bak`

For community edition:

```sh
wget -O .env https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/env
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/seafile-server.yml
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/caddy.yml
```

For pro edition:

```sh
wget -O .env https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/pro/12.0/env
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/pro/12.0/seafile-server.yml
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/pro/12.0/caddy.yml
```

The following fields merit particular attention:

* The volume directory of Seafile data (SEAFILE_VOLUME, same as the seafile volumes in the old docker-compose.yml)
* The volume directory of MySQL data (SEAFILE_MYSQL_VOLUME, same as the mysql volumes in the old docker-compose.yml)
* The volume directory of Elasticsearch data (SEAFILE_ELASTICSEARCH_VOLUME, pro edition only, same as the elasticsearch volumes in the old docker-compose.yml)
* The volume directory of Caddy data (SEAFILE_CADDY_VOLUME)
* The user of MySQL (SEAFILE_MYSQL_DB_USER, `database` - `user` can be found in `conf/seafile.conf`)
* The password of MySQL (SEAFILE_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD, `database` - `password` can be found in `conf/seafile.conf`)
* jwt (JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, A random string with a length of no less than 32 characters, generate example: `pwgen -s 40 1`)
* SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME (SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME, same as the SEAFILE_SERVER_HOSTNAME in the old docker-compose.yml)
* SEAFILE_SERVER_PROTOCOL (SEAFILE_SERVER_PROTOCOL, use http or https)

SSL is now handled by the caddy server. If you have used SSL before, you will also need modify the seafile.nginx.conf. Change server listen 443 to 80.

Backup the original seafile.nginx.conf file:

```sh
cp seafile.nginx.conf seafile.nginx.conf.bak
```

Remove the `server listen 80` section:

```config
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    server_name _ default_server;

    # allow certbot to connect to challenge location via HTTP Port 80
    # otherwise renewal request will fail
#    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
#        alias /var/www/challenges/;
#        try_files $uri =404;
#    }

#    location / {
#        rewrite ^ https://example.seafile.com$request_uri? permanent;
#    }
#}
```

Change `server listen 443` to `80`:

```config
server {
#listen 443 ssl;
listen 80;

#    ssl_certificate      /shared/ssl/pkg.seafile.top.crt;
#    ssl_certificate_key  /shared/ssl/pkg.seafile.top.key;

#    ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS;

   ...
```

Start with docker compose up.

### Upgrade SeaDoc from 0.8 to 1.0 for Seafile v12.0

If you have deployed SeaDoc extension in version 11.0, please use the following steps to upgrade it to version 1.0.

SeaDoc 1.0 is for working with Seafile 12.0. SeaDoc and Seafile are deployed in the same directory. SeaDoc has no state in itself. You can simplify delete old configuration file and directory of v0.8. Then deploy SeaDoc 1.0 as following.

In version 1.0, we use .env file to configure SeaDoc docker image, instead of modifying the docker-compose.yml file directly.

Download [seadoc.yml](https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/seadoc.yml) to the Seafile `seafile-server.yml` directory, then modify Seafile .env file.

For community edition:

```sh
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/ce/12.0/seadoc.yml
```

For pro edition:

```sh
wget https://manual.seafile.com/docker/docker-compose/pro/12.0/seadoc.yml
```

```env
COMPOSE_FILE='seafile-server.yml,caddy.yml,seadoc.yml'

SEADOC_VOLUME=/opt/seadoc-data
ENABLE_SEADOC=true
SEADOC_SERVER_URL=http://example.seafile.com/sdoc-server
```

The following fields merit particular attention:

* Add `seadoc.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` field.
* The volume directory of SeaDoc data (SEADOC_VOLUME)
* Enable SeaDoc (ENABLE_SEADOC)
* SeaDoc service url (SEADOC_SERVER_URL, hostname + `/sdoc-server`)

If you have deployed SeaDoc older version, you should remove `/sdoc-server/`, `/socket.io` configs in seafile.nginx.conf file.

```config
#    location /sdoc-server/ {
#        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
#        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS;
#        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "deviceType,token, authorization, content-type";
#        if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
#            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
#            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS;
#            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "deviceType,token, authorization, content-type";
#            return 204;
#        }
#        proxy_pass         http://sdoc-server:7070/;
#        proxy_redirect     off;
#        proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
#        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
#        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host  $server_name;
#        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
#        client_max_body_size 100m;
#    }
#    location /socket.io {
#        proxy_pass http://sdoc-server:7070;
#        proxy_http_version 1.1;
#        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
#        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
#        proxy_redirect off;
#        proxy_buffers 8 32k;
#        proxy_buffer_size 64k;
#        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
#        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
#    }
```

Start Seafile server and SeaDoc server with the following command

```sh
docker compose down

docker compose up -d
```
